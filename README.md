This android app was written by Noah Davidson, Billy Lai, Devon Long, Ekaterina Tcareva, and Jaewon Jungfor for the "Software Methodology" class at UCSC. 
Our goal was to create a project using agile methodology. We had only three weeks, thus, we decided to create a small set of simple games. Every member had a own "work field". 
I implemented "School House" game.
