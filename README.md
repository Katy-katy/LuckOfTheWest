# Luck Of The West Adventure Game.
This android app was written by Noah Davidson, Billy Lai, Devon Long, Ekaterina Tcareva, and Jaewon Jungfor for the "Software Methodology" class at UCSC. 
Our goal was to create a project using agile methodology. We had only three weeks, thus, we decided to create a small set of simple games. Every member had a own "work field". I implemented "School House" game. 
Please, see Documentation folder to get more info about the project.
